Write a bedtime story about a bat who is afraid of dark for children aged 5 to 7.**

**AIM:**

To create a bedtime story for children aged 5–7 about a bat who is afraid of the dark, using prompt-engineering techniques to generate creative and age-appropriate content.

**ALOGORITHM:**

Step 1: Define the main theme — a bat who is afraid of the dark. Step 2: Identify the target audience (children aged 5–7) to ensure the story is simple, engaging, and safe. Step 3: Structure the story with a clear beginning (introduction of the bat), middle (conflict/challenge), and end (resolution and happy conclusion). Step 4: Use prompt-engineering techniques to guide the AI into producing creative, child-friendly, and bedtime-appropriate output. Step 5: Review and refine the generated story for clarity, flow, and suitability for the target age group.

**PROGRAM:**
